The Turret Lifecycle

A Turret is plugged into a network
It sends a registration request to machine gun with it's turret_id, and a configuration form (as a json representation of drupal's form api)
A user may claim a turret by it's id (the id is unique enough to allow any user to claim a turret by id alone)
Once claimed a user may manage his turrets.
